This documentation is designed to help developers onboard quickly and become productive members of the KwikPOS development team. What is KwikPOS? KwikPOS is a modern, offline-first Point of Sale (POS) system built to streamline food and retail operations with features including inventory management, sales tracking, and advanced analytics. Key Advantage: Unlike cloud-based POS systems, KwikPOS operates offline-first, ensuring uninterrupted operations even without internet connectivity. We also provide real-time data syncing capabilities to our cloud backend for centralized reporting and analytics. POS Application Types We currently have two versions of POS applications that should be known by a KwikPOS developer. Chase POS (Legacy) This is the POS application that is provided by Chase Tech. The source code cannot be modified on our end, and we could only do modifications that are applicable outside of the POS. ( e.g. Exporting of sales data for reports ) We normally request modifications through the Chase developer if we really need it, but if we can do it on our end, we should push that instead. KwikPOS Pro This is our main product is currently being developed continuously. We have full control over the source code here so we are able to cater modification requests directly, unlike the legacy POS. Learn More About Our Products Want to see what we're building?

This guide introduces you to our ecosystem of projects and helps you understand what we build and maintain. Before You Begin Before diving into development, make sure you have the necessary knowledge and tools: Review Prerequisites - Essential knowledge (Git, Java, Spring Boot, etc.) and required development tools Verify you have the appropriate JDK version for your project Ensure your development environment is set up correctly Project Ecosystem Our ecosystem consists of cloud-based backend services and on-premise API adapters that work together to provide a complete POS solution. Real-time data syncing enables individual POS applications to communicate with our cloud backend server, consolidating sales records from different client stores and branches.

on-premise adapter that enables modern self-ordering kiosks to communicate seamlessly with legacy POS applications, particularly Chase POS, without requiring modifications to the existing POS software. Tech Stack Framework: Spring Boot 3.5.4 Runtime: Java 17 Deployment: Apache Tomcat 10.0 Deployment Location: On-premise POS machine System Architecture The following sequence diagram illustrates how the KwikPOS API processes orders from kiosks to the legacy POS system: Key Features Kiosk Integration API server for self-ordering kiosk integration Real-time order transmission from kiosks to POS terminals Support for modern kiosk interfaces Data Transformation Data transformation layer between modern kiosks and legacy POS systems Format conversion and data mapping Protocol adaptation Legacy POS Compatibility Compatibility layer for Chase POS integration Direct integration with legacy POS applications Local Server Runs as local server on POS machine Handles requests from nearby kiosks Low-latency local network communication Responsibilities Order Reception Receives order requests from self-ordering kiosks Validates incoming order data Handles multiple concurrent kiosk connections Data Transformation Transforms order data from modern format to legacy POS format Maps fields and data structures Ensures data compatibility POS Communication Transmits orders to the connected POS terminal Handles POS-specific protocols Manages error responses and retries Bridge Layer Serves as the communication bridge between modern ordering interfaces and legacy systems Maintains session state Provides logging and monitoring Deployment Architecture Infrastructure Location: Installed on individual POS machines acting as local servers Application Server: Apache Tomcat 10.0 servlet container Network: Local network access for nearby kiosks Integration: Direct connection with Chase POS application Database: Direct MS SQL Server database connection Deployment Characteristics Scope: Single store deployment Isolation: Each installation serves one POS terminal Network: Local LAN communication ( 0.0.0.0 ) Availability: Must be running whenever kiosks are operational Configuration POS machine-specific settings Kiosk connection parameters Legacy POS integration settings Network and security configuration Development Environment Setup Prerequisites Refer to Prerequisites for detailed requirements.
