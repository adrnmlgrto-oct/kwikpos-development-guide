# Welcome to KwikPOS Developer Guide

Welcome to the **KwikPOS Developer Guide**! This documentation is designed to help developers onboard quickly and become productive members of the KwikPOS development team.

## What is KwikPOS?

KwikPOS is a modern, offline-first Point of Sale (POS) system built to streamline food and retail operations with features including inventory management, sales tracking, and advanced analytics.

**Key Advantage:** Unlike cloud-based POS systems, KwikPOS operates offline-first, ensuring uninterrupted operations even without internet connectivity. We also provide real-time data syncing capabilities to our cloud backend for centralized reporting and analytics.

## POS Application Types

We currently have two versions of POS applications that should be known by a KwikPOS developer.

1. **Chase POS (Legacy)**

    - This is the POS application that is provided by Chase Tech.
    - This can either be of the two versions: *FoodPOS* or *WinPOS (Retail)*.
    - The source code cannot be modified on our end, and we could only do modifications that are applicable outside of the POS. (*e.g. Exporting of sales data for reports*)
    - We normally request modifications through the Chase developer if we really need it, but if we can do it on our end, we should push that instead.

2. **KwikPOS Pro**

    - This is our main product is currently being developed continuously.
    - We have full control over the source code here so we are able to cater modification requests directly, unlike the legacy POS.
