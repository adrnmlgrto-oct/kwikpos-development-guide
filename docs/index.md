## What is KwikPOS?

KwikPOS is a modern, offline-first Point of Sale (POS) system built to streamline food and retail operations with features including inventory management, sales tracking, and advanced analytics.

**Key Advantage:** Unlike cloud-based POS systems, KwikPOS operates offline-first, ensuring uninterrupted operations even without internet connectivity. We also provide real-time data syncing capabilities to our cloud backend for centralized reporting and analytics.
